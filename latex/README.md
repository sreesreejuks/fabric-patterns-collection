# Enhanced LaTeX Generation ðŸ“„âœ¨

## Overview

While AI LaTeX generation cannot be entirely controlled, this enhanced pattern improves upon the original by adding common rules to prevent some errors in the generated code.

## Enhancements

- **Escape Special Characters:** Properly escape LaTeX special characters (e.g., `&`, `%`, `$`, `#`, `_`, `{`, `}`, `~`, `^`, `\`) in the text to prevent compilation errors.
- **Quotation Handling:** Use curly quotation marks for quoted text or employ the `csquotes` package for advanced and consistent quotation formatting.
- **Define Common Terms:** Create new commands for frequently used terms with special characters (e.g., `\newcommand{\DEI}{DE\&I}`) to ensure consistency and simplify maintenance.
- **Section Numbering Control:** Utilize starred sectioning commands (e.g., `\section*`) to manage automatic numbering of sections and subsections unless numbering is explicitly requested.
- **Consistent Command Usage:** Apply defined commands uniformly throughout the document to maintain a consistent style and reduce redundancy.
- **Environment and Command Closure:** Ensure that all LaTeX environments and commands are properly opened and closed to avoid syntax errors and ensure document integrity.
- **Code Readability:** Implement proper indentation and formatting in the LaTeX code to enhance readability and ease of future modifications.
- **Modern Package Usage:** Avoid deprecated packages like `inputenc` unless necessary, ensuring compatibility with current LaTeX distributions and best practices.
- **Comment Management:** Place any additional comments or non-essential information within `\iffalse ... \fi` sections to keep the main output clean and focused on valid LaTeX code.
- **Exclude `fontspec`:** Do not use the `fontspec` package to prevent potential compilation issues, especially when not required by the document setup.

## Comments
- This pattern was tested on various models and demonstrates improved rendering over the original, particularly with languages that include accented characters, such as French. That being said, AI LaTeX generation can fail and in such case, it is also worth trying the original Fabric **write_latex** pattern.
- In some cases where the LaTeX -> pdf creation fails, try creating the .tex file first and then use to_pdf rather than piping the LaTeX output to to_pdf.
