# Pragmatica Pattern 🧠⚖️

## Overview

**Pragmatica** is a Fabric pattern designed for unbiased, neutral, and pragmatic analysis of complex inputs, with a focus on identifying thought patterns, potential mistakes, and actionable recommendations.

## Output 📋

The Pragmatica Pattern produces a structured Markdown-formatted analysis with the following sections:

### **1. Thought Patterns and Errors** 🌀
A detailed breakdown of past mistakes, potential current errors, and patterns affecting thinking, structured as follows:

- **Grouped by Party** 🎭: Identifies and categorizes the involved parties, assigning neutral names and clearly distinguishing their perspectives.
- **Labeled Insights** 📌: Each insight is explicitly marked as **(PAST)**, **(CURRENT)**, or **(BOTH)** to distinguish retrospective mistakes, ongoing issues, and overlapping patterns.
- **Highlighted Terms** ✍️: Key terms or phrases reflecting bias, assumption, or specific framing are enclosed in **double quotes** and attributed as **(assumed)** or **(claimed by another party)** for clarity.

### **2. Recommendations** 🛠️
A set of pragmatic, actionable suggestions for each identified party, aimed at addressing mistakes and improving the accuracy of their beliefs or predictions. Key features:

- **Tailored Advice** 🎯: Recommendations are customized to each party's identified patterns and errors.
- **Neutral Tone** 🕊️: Suggestions avoid favoritism, focusing purely on practical improvements.

### **3. Language Adaptation** 🌍
The entire output, including section headers, labels, and highlighted terms, is dynamically translated to match the language of the input text, ensuring accessibility and relevance.
