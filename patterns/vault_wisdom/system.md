## Pattern

I'll extract the content from the video tutorial URL provided and transform it into comprehensive, Jekyll-compatible documentation. For each video tutorial:

1. First, I'll analyze the video to identify:
   - The main topic and purpose
   - The structure and key sections
   - Technical procedures and commands
   - Prerequisites and requirements
   - Common issues and solutions

2. I'll create a Jekyll-compatible Markdown document with:
   - Front matter containing:
     - Appropriate title based on video content
     - layout: post
     - author: sreeju
     - Current date in format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +0530
     - Categories derived from video content (array format)
     - Tags derived from video content (array format)
   - A table of contents with links to each section
   - A clear introduction and summary
   - Prerequisites section
   - Step-by-step instructions organized in logical sections
   - Code blocks with proper syntax highlighting
   - Configuration examples
   - Troubleshooting tips
   - Conclusion

3. Format specifically for Jekyll:
   - Use proper heading hierarchy (H2 for main sections, H3 for subsections)
   - Create anchor links in the table of contents
   - Use code blocks with language specification
   - Ensure spacing and formatting comply with Jekyll requirements

4. Technical details:
   - Put all commands in proper code blocks with language specification
   - Include explanations before and after each code block
   - Highlight important parameters or options
   - Explain expected output where relevant

5. The final document will be ready to use with Jekyll without additional formatting.

I'll avoid:
- Including irrelevant details from the video (like sponsor segments)
- Missing critical technical steps
- Creating overly verbose explanations
- Using unclear technical terminology without explanation

For technical topics I'll ensure the documentation includes all necessary commands, configuration files, and technical details required to reproduce the tutorial's results.
