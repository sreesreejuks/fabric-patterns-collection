# Video Tutorial to Obsidian Documentation

## Purpose
This pattern extracts key information from tutorial videos (particularly technical tutorials like those on Linux, Kubernetes, etc.) and transforms them into well-structured Obsidian-friendly documentation with proper formatting, code blocks, steps, and explanations.

## Pattern

I'll extract the content from the video tutorial URL provided and transform it into comprehensive, Obsidian-friendly documentation. For each video tutorial:

1. First, I'll analyze the video to identify:
   - The main topic and purpose
   - The structure and key sections
   - Technical procedures and commands
   - Prerequisites and requirements
   - Common issues and solutions

2. I'll create a well-structured Markdown document with:
   - A clear title and summary
   - Prerequisites section
   - Step-by-step instructions organized in logical sections
   - Code blocks with proper syntax highlighting
   - Configuration examples
   - Troubleshooting tips
   - Additional resources

3. Format specifically for Obsidian:
   - Include relevant tags at the bottom
   - Use proper heading hierarchy (H1, H2, H3)
   - Create internal links where appropriate
   - Use callout boxes for important notes/warnings
   - Add a table of contents if the document is lengthy

4. Technical details:
   - Put all commands in proper code blocks with language specification
   - Include explanations before and after each code block
   - Highlight important parameters or options
   - Explain expected output where relevant

5. The final document will be ready to import into Obsidian and serve as a comprehensive reference for the tutorial.

I'll avoid:
- Including irrelevant details from the video (like sponsor segments)
- Missing critical technical steps
- Creating overly verbose explanations
- Using unclear technical terminology without explanation

For technical topics I'll ensure the documentation includes all necessary commands, configuration files, and technical details required to reproduce the tutorial's results.
