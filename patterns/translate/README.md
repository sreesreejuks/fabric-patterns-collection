# Translate 🌐📜

## Overview

**Translate** is a Fabric pattern designed for precise, context-aware translation of texts into a destination language. It focuses on retaining the original tone, structure, and meaning while producing translations that are linguistically accurate and culturally relevant.

This pattern dynamically detects the target language from language codes (e.g., `en-us` for American English, `fr` for French, `it` for Italian) or contextual hints within the input. 

💡 Destination language should be provides in the command line or added to the input text.

## Credits 🙌

**Translate** is inspired by the original **Fabric Translate** pattern, from which the variable `{lang_code}` was removed.
