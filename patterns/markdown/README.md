# markdown 📝✨

## Overview

The `markdown` pattern is designed to convert content into clean, well-structured Markdown format. The goal of this pattern is to ensure that the original content is preserved and accurately transformed into Markdown, while irrelevant or extraneous elements are removed.

## The Pattern will try:

1. **To Extract Relevant Content** 🧐:
   - Identify and preserve the complete original content from the provided input.
   - Remove all unrelated elements such as advertisements, comments, disclaimers, navigation links, HTML tags, and other non-essential data.

2. **Markdown Conversion** 📄:
   - Accurately replicate the structure, formatting, links, quotes, and code blocks in Markdown.
   - Ensure the content remains consistent with its original form, except for cleaning irrelevant elements.
   - Proper headings, lists, and paragraphs.
   - Embedded links, quotes, and code blocks.
   - Preserved formatting and structure.

3. **To Adhere to High Standards** ✅:
   - Maintain all original wording, punctuation, and formatting.
   - Avoid truncation, omission, or placeholders in the output.

4. **Thorough Review** 🔍:
   - Verify the output to ensure it matches the original content exactly, without losing any essential information.

5. **Noise Removal** 🚮: Strips out non-content elements, including:
  - Advertisements (e.g., banner ads, pop-ups).
  - User comments and discussions unrelated to the main text.
  - Disclaimers (e.g., legal notices or copyright statements).
  - HTML tags or non-visible code (e.g., `<div>`, `<script>`).
  - Navigation menus and subscription prompts.
  - Social media widgets and sharing buttons.
